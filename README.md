A good intro talk about the Rust programming language, with brilliant Q&A
section: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1uraoHM8Gg

But two things a missing:
  * Ergonomics, usability and quality of implementation of the language. They
    are really high with rust (for example, a story about stability:
    http://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html)
  * It's really hard to grasp the rust ownership model from the slides, because it
    is not what is found in mainstream languages (although C++11 with move
    semantics goes in this direction). You'll have to write some code to
    appreciate borrow checker =)

Found knowledge: always prefer `git push --force-with-lease` to  `git push
--force`. Nice [explanation](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/).

Thank you, Magit!
